# Palks Studio — Public Showcase

This repository contains the public showcase of Palks Studio.

It brings together the website, presentation resources, and publicly accessible documents, with a focus on clarity, readability, and transparency.

This repository is not a product, a framework, or a software library.  
It is a reference support intended to help understand the approach, tools, and decisions behind Palks Studio.

## About Palks Studio

Palks Studio designs technical tools, documentation structures, and working environments intended to be:  

- readable  
- understandable  
- autonomous  
- maintainable over time

The focus is placed on:  

- functional simplicity  
- dependency control  
- transparency of technical choices  
- durability over trends

## Repository contents

### 1. The Palks Studio website (public version)

The website pages present:  

- the studio and its approach  
- the available resources  
- the conceptual foundations  
- the technical tools developed  
- the legal and informational pages

The site is deliberately sober, static, and readable.  
It serves as an entry point to public resources and projects.

### 2. Public resources and presentations

Some resources are provided as documents or archives, particularly when the content includes:  

- multiple files  
- complete structures  
- examples or educational material

These elements are grouped into dedicated folders to preserve the overall clarity of the repository.

---

### 3. Example structure

The `public_version/` folder contains files illustrating the logical structure of certain projects or resources.

These are not executable tools, but structural references intended to explain the organization and the underlying principles.

## What this repository is

- A technical and documentary showcase

## Transparency and approach

Palks Studio deliberately chooses to:  

- document projects seriously  
- explain technical choices and limitations  
- avoid vague promises  
- avoid hiding work behind marketing

The code, structures, and documentation are designed to be understood before any decision to use or purchase.

This repository is part of that transparency-driven approach.
